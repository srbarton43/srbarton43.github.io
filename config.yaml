      Hello there! I'm Sam.

      <br><br>

      I'm a 4th year Computer Science student at Dartmouth College with an interest in systems design and the intersection between computer software and computer hardware. Recently I have been researching implemtations of memory-safe computer architectures from companies such as Arm, Intel, and AMD with a small team at Dartmouth. I am currently an Undergrad Teaching Assistant for Computer Architecture with Professor Sean Smith.
